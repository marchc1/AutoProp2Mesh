# AutoProp2Mesh

A Blender 4.2 – 5.2 extension for building [Prop2Mesh](https://github.com/ACF-Team/Prop2Mesh) entities in Blender and exporting them as AdvDupe2 (revision 5) dupes for Garry's Mod.

**New here? Read the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md).**

## Install

1. Build the extension zip, or use the prebuilt one in `dist/`:
   ```
   blender --command extension build --source-dir src/autoprop2mesh --output-dir dist
   ```
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions**, open the drop-down menu, choose **Install from Disk…**, and pick `dist/autoprop2mesh-<version>.zip`.
3. In the extension's preferences:
   - The Garry's Mod folder is auto-detected through Steam.
   - Add any extra content folders, e.g. a shared legacy addons tree. A folder counts as content if it holds `models/` or `materials/`, and folders of such folders also work.

The first content scan takes about 10 seconds and runs in the background. After that, a cached index makes it take about 0.5 seconds.

## Workflow

| Step | How |
|---|---|
| Add an entity | **Add > Prop2Mesh Entity**, or the **P2M** sidebar tab (N panel) |
| Pick its model | Use the model field in the sidebar. 📁 opens the model browser (with previews), 🔍 searches by path |
| Add controllers | Use the controller list in the sidebar. Each controller has a name, color + alpha, material, UV scale and bump |
| Attach geometry | Select the objects, then the entity last, and press **Ctrl+P > Attach mesh to Controller …** |
| Nest entities | Parent an entity to another entity (normal Ctrl+P). The parenting is exported |
| Export | **File > Export > AdvDupe2 Prop2Mesh (.txt)**. It defaults to `garrysmod/data/advdupe2` |

- **Parts:** any mesh, curve, surface, metaball or text object below an entity is a part, including indirect children. A part uses its own controller, or inherits the one set on the nearest object above it.
- **Exported geometry:** the evaluated geometry (with modifiers applied). The entity's own model is never exported as geometry; it is only the entity's `Model`.
- **Materials:** parts get their controller's material in object-linked slots, so their own materials are kept and come back when they are detached or unparented.
- **Preview:** Material Preview shows the texture × color with Prop2Mesh's box-projected UVs. Solid view with **Color: Texture** shows the same thing, and **Color: Material** shows the flat controller color.
- **Shading:** set per part in the sidebar. **Auto** exports flat or smooth from the mesh, using the *Smooth by Angle* modifier's angle when one is present.
- **Coordinates:** 1 Blender unit = 1 Source unit by default (change it in the sidebar's *Units / BU*). Positions map straight across, and +X is the entity's forward. Blender's world origin is the point the dupe pastes at.

## Model parts

A model part is a Prop2Mesh part built from a game model, just like a prop_physics turned into P2M. Only the model path and placement are exported, never vertices.

| Step | How |
|---|---|
| Add one | **Add > Prop2Mesh Model Part** (or *Add Model Part* in the sidebar), then attach it with **Ctrl+P** like a mesh |
| Model | The same model field, browser and search as entities |
| Body groups | Pick from the drop-downs in the Part panel. They are previewed and exported as P2M's bodygroup mask |
| Scale | The object's scale (non-uniform is fine) |
| Clipping | **Add Clip Plane** creates a child plane. Move and rotate it to cut the model live. The arrow points to the side that is kept, and **Flip** reverses it. Like P2M, cuts are left open |
| Shading | Model normals, or **Flat Shading**, plus **Render Inside** |

With a controller UV scale of 0, model parts keep the model's own UVs; otherwise they are box-projected like meshes, which is what Prop2Mesh does.

## Things Prop2Mesh itself ignores

- **UVs:** Prop2Mesh box-projects UVs from vertex positions, so your UV unwraps don't carry over. The preview shows the real result.
- **Normals:** normals are recomputed from faces (flat, or smoothed by angle), so custom split normals are lost.
- **Triangle limit:** a single part is limited to 21,333 triangles. Larger objects are split into several parts automatically.
